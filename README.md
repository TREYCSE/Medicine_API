# Medicine_API

Imagine the machine running tests taking in all your data...eventually spitting out a sum of it inluding an informal but pretty accurate "diagnosis". Well, this exists. The technician directs the machine but it does the interpretation itself. This is the advanced world of medical technology. I aim to gather a "master" database of focused medical research data to build my own public API, that will be transformed into a machine learning system that will accurately consider all of a user's information before providing them a slew of userfriendly health data about themselves.

## Features - QUERYS for Developers (chart in API documentation)
Users will be asked extensive questions aiming to gather their entire health history including:

>2. 

## Technologies - How will this work? Backend API building into Machine Learning

## CODING INCORPORATED IN BUILDING THE API 
#### File Tree:

            /lib
                /db
                    /1 seed.js
                    /2 connection.js
                /controllers
                    /1
                    /2
                    /3
                /models
                    /1
                    /2
                    /3
                /routes
                    /1 index.js
                    /2
                index.js


## CODE COMMENTS - What is each file responsible for and linked to?
### /db - the Database
1) seed.js - Seeding the data with Mongoose
2) connection.js - connecting to Mongoose server
